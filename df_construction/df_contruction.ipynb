The MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset is wholly derived from MIMIC-CXR, providing JPG format files derived from the DICOM images and structured labels derived from the free-text reports. The aim of MIMIC-CXR-JPG is to provide a convenient processed version of MIMIC-CXR, as well as to provide a standard reference for data splits and image labels. The dataset contains 377,110 JPG format images and structured labels derived from the 227,827 free-text radiology reports associated with these images. The dataset is de-identified to satisfy the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Safe Harbor requirements. Protected health information (PHI) has been removed. The dataset is intended to support a wide body of research in medicine including image understanding, natural language processing, and decision support.\n",

      "* ProcedureCodeSequence_CodeMeaning - The human readable description of the coded procedure (e.g. \"CHEST (PA AND LAT)\". Descriptions follow Simon-Leeming codes [11].\n",
      "* ViewCodeSequence_CodeMeaning - The human readable description of the coded view orientation for the image (e.g. \"postero-anterior\", \"antero-posterior\", \"lateral\").\n",

Thus, it is possible for a study in the CheXpert set to have no labels assigned. For example, study 57321224 has the following findings/impression text: \"Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute disease.\". Normally this would be assigned a label of \"No Finding\", but the use of \"hyperinflation\" suppresses the labeling of no finding. For details see the CheXpert article [8], and the list of phrases are publicly available in their code repository (phrases/mention/no_finding.txt). There are 2414 studies which do not have a label assigned by CheXpert. Conversely, all studies present in the provided files have been assigned a label by NegBio.\n",

      "    * e.g. \"A large pleural effusion\"\n",
      "* 0.0 - The label was negatively mentioned in the associated study, and therefore should not be present in any of the corresponding images\n",
